A mostly incremental upgrade over the original RX 6600 but with many of the new features from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/review-amds-radeon-rx-7900-gpus-are-great-4k-gaming-gpus-with-caveats/">RX 7900 XTX and XT</a>, it would come with a price cut, from the RX 6600''s $329 to $299. Nvidia then briefed the press on its new mainstream RTX 4060 series. The prices for the higher-end 8GB and 16GB RTX 4060 Ti are already set at $399 and $499. The price for the lower-end RTX 4060 was left undisclosed.</p>\n<p>A few days later, presumably having caught wind of AMD''s pricing plan for the RX 7600, Nvidia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/">announced the price for the RTX 4060</a>: also a surprisingly low $299. (This entire time, review embargoes and briefings have been shifting by a few days here and there as the companies maneuver around each other.) Then, around 36 hours before this article was published, a new update came from AMD: The RX 7600 will now be launching for $269, $30 less than the RTX 4060 and $50 less than the old RX 6600.</p>\n\n<p>This is what competition in the mid-range GPU market looks like after a years-long cryptocurrency-and-scalper-fueled shortage and many more months of Nvidia and AMD focusing on their pricey flagships. These are new, modern cards with modern features available at a price that can at least be called "literally affordable" even if they aren''t quite "budget."</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941045#p3">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941045&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-24 13:00:05','Andrew Cunningham','https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941045');

The Z3 coupe''s "clown shoe" nickname was not at all affectionate. And few could find a kind word about the infamous "Bangle butt" on the fourth-gen 7 Series. But it doesn''t take those kinds of risks with every model, particularly not the latest 5 Series, which now includes a fully electric i5.</p>\n<p>The 5 Series is BMW''s midsize sedan, and until the advent of the luxury SUV—a category that BMW basically invented—it was the company''s bread and butter. There''s a new 5 Series out this October, the eighth generation to bear the nameplate. Like other recent BMWs, it uses the manufacturer''s latest flexible architecture that supports battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and conventional powertrains, something we''ve seen to good effect with the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2023-bmw-i4-is-the-electric-bmw-sedan-youve-been-waiting-for/">4 Series</a> and particularly with last year''s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/how-the-the-wire-helped-me-understand-the-2023-bmw-760i-xdrive/">7 Series</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/testing-bmws-biggest-and-best-sedan-now-fully-electric-the-2023-i7/">i7</a>.</p>\n<div class="image shortcode-img center"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2024-BMW-i5-preview-12-scaled.jpg"><img alt="Now try to picture it wearing a taxi livery or perhaps a police version." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2024-BMW-i5-preview-12-980x735.jpg" /></a><p class="caption" style="font-size: 0.8em;"><a class="caption-link" href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2024-BMW-i5-preview-12-scaled.jpg" rel="nofollow">Now try to picture it wearing a taxi livery or perhaps a police version.</a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>\n<h2>The sedan is not dead</h2>\n<p>"We''re particularly happy with how it turned out proportion-wise. I think it is a long, elegant, sporty sedan, and that, for me, is the essence of any BMW anyway. And the 5 series, of course, is the core of the brand in many, many markets," said Adrian van Hooydonk, design director at BMW Group.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941561#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941561&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-24 12:00:42','Jonathan M.

That''s largely due to many iconic illustrations commemorating the event that found their way into the popular imagination and became part of our shared cultural lore. But most of those classic illustrations are riddled with historical errors, according to a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-023-00421-y">new paper</a> published in the journal Science and Education.</p>\n<p>Franklin''s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/that-time-benjamin-franklin-tried-and-failed-to-electrocute-a-turkey/">explorations into electricity</a> began as he was approaching 40 years old after his thriving career as an entrepreneur in the printing business. His scientific interest was piqued in 1743 when he saw a demonstration by scientist/showman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Spencer">Archibald Spencer</a>, known for performing various amusing parlor tricks involving electricity. He soon started a correspondence with a British botanist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Collinson_(botanist)">Peter Collinson</a> and began reproducing some of Spencer''s impressive parlor tricks in his own home.</p>\n<p>He would have guests rub a tube to create static and then have them kiss, producing an electrical shock. He designed a fake spider suspended by two electrified wires so that it seemed to swing back and forth of its own accord. And he devised a game dubbed "Treason," whereby he wired up a portrait of King George so that anyone who touched the monarch''s crown would be shocked. And he once infamously shocked himself while trying to kill a turkey with electricity. </p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941212#p3">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941212&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-23 22:46:20','Jennifer Ouellette','https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941212');

It originated from a verified Twitter account named "Bloomberg Feed," unaffiliated with the well-known Bloomberg media company, and was quickly exposed as a hoax.

The company''s first swing at the idea came in 2016 with the <a href="https://www.dyson.com/support/journey/guides/64989-01?machineId=64989-01">Dyson 360 Eye</a>, which sported a weird tall and stumpy form factor that didn''t fit under furniture. A 2020 sequel, the <a href="https://www.dyson.ie/vacuum-cleaners/robot-vacuums/dyson-360-heurist/dyson-360-heurist-overview">Dyson 360 Heurist</a>, kept the ultra-tall form factor and<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/first-look-dyson-360-heurist-robot-wants-to-be-the-smartest-vacuum-cleaner-ever"> wasn''t even released</a> in the US as a result. This new robovac, the "<a href="https://www.dyson.co.uk/newsroom/overview/news/may-2023/dyson-launches-most-powerful-robot-vacuum">Dyson 360 Vis Nav</a>," opts for a more typical low, wide body design, making it look like a normal robot vacuum. Or at least, it''s as normal as a Dyson product can ever look—it still has a screaming metallic purple paint job and what looks like a silver <em>Alien</em>-like facehugger on the top deck.</p>\n<p>Old Dyson robovacs were around 9 inches wide and 4.7 inches tall, so the company previously opted for a robot with a small footprint and a tall body. That theoretically allowed it to maneuver into tighter places than your average short, flat disk vacuum, but it can''t kill the dust bunnies under the couch. Dyson says this new model can fit under a 99 mm (3.9 inch) tall gap, which is right in line with the normal height of a Roomba. It''s also D-shaped now, like a Neato vac or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/the-2019-roomba-gets-an-all-new-design-companion-mop-bot/">high-end Roomba</a>, which allows for a wider coverage path and to really get into those corners.</p>\n<p>Edge coverage is normally done by a spinning brush, but you won''t find one here. Instead, there is what looks like an extendable, L-shaped red squeegee just behind the brush bar. When the robot detects a wall, the squeegee extends to connect with the wall, and Dyson says this will "redirect suction" and pick up everything.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941294#p3">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941294&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-23 20:17:24','Ron Amadeo','https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941294');

For example, those surveyed were asked if they agreed with reducing the number of voting facilities in towns that support the opposing party. Similar questions got at things like banning rallies, limiting freedom of expression, ignoring court rulings, or resorting to violence.

Powered by Adobe Firefly, Generative Fill works similarly to a technique called "inpainting" used in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/openai-image-generator-dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist/">DALL-E</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/">Stable Diffusion</a> releases since last year.</p>\n\n<p>At the core of Generative Fill is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ethical-ai-art-generation-adobe-firefly-may-be-the-answer/">Adobe Firefly</a>, which is Adobe''s custom image-synthesis model. As a deep learning AI model, Firefly has been trained on millions of images in Adobe''s stock library to associate certain imagery with text descriptions of them. Now part of Photoshop, people can type in what they want to see (i.e., "a clown on a computer monitor"), and Firefly will synthesize several options for the user to choose from. Generative Fill uses a well-known AI technique called "<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/research/inpainting/index.html">inpainting</a>" to create a context-aware generation that can seamlessly blend synthesized imagery into an existing image.</p>\n<p>To use Generative Fill, users select an area of an existing image they want to modify. After selecting it, a "Contextual Task Bar" pops up that allows users to type in a description of what they want to see generated in the selected area. Photoshop sends this data to Adobe''s servers for processing, then returns results in the app. After generating, the user has the option to select between several options of generations or to create more options to browse through.</p></div><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941261#p3">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href="https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941261&amp;comments=1">Comments</a></p>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-23 19:07:19','Benj Edwards','https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941261');

The\nproposed law would require tech companies to scan their platforms,\nincluding users’ private messages, to find illegal material.\nHowever, the proposal from Ylva Johansson, the EU commissioner in\ncharge of home affairs, has drawn ire from cryptographers,\ntechnologists, and privacy advocates for its potential impact on\nend-to-end encryption. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Of the 20 EU countries represented in the document leaked to\nWIRED, the majority said they are in favor of some form of\nscanning of encrypted messages, with Spain’s position emerging as\nthe most extreme. “Ideally, in our view, it would be desirable to\nlegislatively prevent EU-based service providers from implementing\nend-to-end encryption,” Spanish representatives said in the\ndocument.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the EU goes ahead with this, I think it means the end of services like WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage in the EU. There’s no way to architect a messaging system that uses E2EE in some regions and doesn’t in others. The only way to comply would be to rearchitect these systems to not use E2EE anywhere.

There is no he-said/she-said debate here. The cryptographers are correct and the lawmakers are so ignorant that they’re proposing a fantasy. It’s a downwind effect of Arthur C. Clarke’s famous maxim that sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic: the technology of E2EE is so far above the heads of lawmakers and law enforcement officials that they feel free to demand magic solutions. “<em>Just <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/01/12/imaginary-numbers.html">nerd harder</a></em>.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Netherlands, however, stated that this would be possible\nthrough “on-device” scanning before the illegal material is\nencrypted and sent to its recipient. “There are … technologies\nwhich may allow for automatic detection of CSAM while at the same\ntime leaving end-to-end encryption intact,” the country’s\nrepresentatives stated in the document.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somewhere in Cupertino, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/08/apple_child_safety_initiatives_slippery_slope">a head bangs against a desk</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/wired-spain-e2ee" title="Permanent link to ‘Leaked EU Document Shows Spain Wants to Ban End-to-End Encryption; Other EU Countries Hanging Their Hopes on Impossible Solutions’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-23 00:55:01','John Gruber','https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/');

The WWDC keynote is <em>always</em> packed. And in recent years, Federighi has gotten Apple’s software factory into such disciplined shape that there are always major updates to every single platform. There are going to be major new features to announce and demo for iOS/iPadOS 17, MacOS 14, and WatchOS 10. I suspect we’re going to see new Mac hardware announced. If it’s just the 15-inch MacBook Air, that’s an easy announcement: it’s a MacBook Air with a bigger display. But if it’s the M-series Mac Pro (finally), <em>that’s</em> going to demand some presentation time. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000565413850">Last year’s keynote</a> ran 1h:48m; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23141939/apple-wwdc-2022-biggest-announcements-ios-16-macbook-air-macos-watchos">here’s a rundown from The Verge</a> of the major announcements.</p>\n\n<p>But I do think the headset is going to be announced at WWDC. There’s just too much smoke for there not to be a fire. And, seemingly, Apple isn’t quietly trying to dampen expectations for the headset behind the scenes. The same thing happened with the iPhone before Macworld Expo 2007 — there were rampant rumors that the Apple phone was finally coming, and no one hearing from sources that it wouldn’t. They might have ideally wanted to announce it <em>before</em> this year’s WWDC at a special event, but if they want developers to start creating software for the platform, this is the time. (And why wouldn’t they want developers to start working on ideas?)</p>\n\n<p>Apple does not like for keynotes to run longer than two hours. The glaring exception that springs to mind was the WWDC 2015 keynote, which ran a grueling 2h:25m. That was the one with a long section on Apple Music with Jimmy Iovine on stage. Probably the worst WWDC keynote ever, and the only one that ever felt under-rehearsed.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the thing though: post-COVID keynotes aren’t just pre-recorded, they’re very tightly edited. I suspect we’ll get a keynote that still comes in under 2 hours even with an entire 40-minute-ish segment announcing both the headset and xrOS. It’ll just go fast. Fitting the headset and xrOS developer frameworks into the old-style on-stage WWDC keynote would have posed a problem. I don’t think it’s a problem with the new “keynote movie” format.<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-19"><a href="https://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2023-05-19">1</a></sup> We won’t come out of the keynote thinking it was too long; we’ll come out of it with our heads spinning because it’s going to cover so much, so fast.</p>\n\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn1-2023-05-19">\n<p>And if I’m right, I bet this is one of those years where after the keynote is over, and people start poring over everything Apple puts on the web, we discover a surprising number of very cool iOS and MacOS features that didn’t make it into the keynote.

Internally he’s warned that\nbuilding the high-performing chips needed for the device could\ndistract from new iPhone chips, which would probably drive more\nrevenue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s some legitimately juicy gossip. But I’m not sure how Federighi, the head of all software at Apple, could keep any distance at all from Apple’s first major new software platform since the iPhone.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Srouji’s group did end up developing some of Apple’s most advanced\nchips to date for the headset, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-07-03/apple-aapl-iphone-apple-watch-take-a-back-seat-to-the-mac-in-chip-upgrades-l55d87p9">iPhone speed gains have\nindeed slowed</a> in recent years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well of course Srouji’s group developed advanced chips for the headset. Where else would the chips come from? “<em>Well Tim, Johny is skeptical about this project, so I guess we’ll commission all the custom silicon designs from Qualcomm.</em>”</p>\n\n<p>And comparing benchmark results for <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/ios-benchmarks/">iPhones</a> vs. <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/android-benchmarks/">Android phones</a>, I’d love to know what speed gains have slowed.

If anything, Apple’s A-series chips are further ahead of the competition than ever in both raw performance and performance-per-watt.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In an attempt to keep headset wearers engaged with the real\nworld, the device will have an outward-facing display showing\ntheir eye movements and facial expressions.

Unlike\nother Apple products, the device is debuting in a\nstill-experimental mode. Apple predicts slower adoption for the\nheadset compared with the Apple Watch or the iPhone, both of which\nquickly became consumer must-haves. Taking seven years in\ndevelopment before hitting the market, it will be one of the most\ncomplex consumer products any company has ever sold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s a lot to unpack in one paragraph. Here goes:</p>\n\n<p>I’d argue Apple has never introduced two new products the same way. Every new product introduction has been different. I honestly don’t know any more about the headset than the rumor mill consensus but I guarantee it isn’t in an “experimental mode”. Neither Apple Watch nor iPhone “quickly became consumer must-haves”. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">Here’s a report from Daisuke Wakabayashi</a> in ... <em>checks notes</em> ... The Wall Street Fucking Journal itself in April 2016, a year after Apple Watch shipped, that says, in the opening paragraph, “Yet the smartwatch is dogged by a perception that seems premature given the history of Apple’s most popular devices: disappointment.” (The next paragraph claimed that “sales of iPhones are slowing”.)<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-18"><a href="https://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2023-05-18">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The pattern for Apple’s entries into new product categories generally goes like this:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apple releases the first version. It’s expensive. It’s missing a few obvious features. It has a few obvious limitations. But it’s a breakthrough.</li>\n<li>Early adopters wait in line outside Apple Stores overnight to buy it. Online sales are backordered by weeks or even months soon after they launch.</li>\n<li>That early fervor aside, it’s an early adopter product, and sales are less than those of Apple’s established products.</li>\n<li>After a few months or maybe a year, the immediate-gratification-obsessed business press runs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-watch-with-sizable-sales-cant-shake-its-critics-1461524901">articles</a> declaring the product a dud.</li>\n<li>Apple releases a second-gen version that’s better. Sales go up. Word continues to spread.</li>\n<li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">With each successive year</a>, Apple releases improved models. Those obvious missing features are added. The obvious limitations are removed. Older models stay on sale at lower price points. It becomes a hit product.</li>\n<li>Years later, when Apple is poised to release another altogether new product, the last one — the one written off as a dud after its first year — is held up as a product that was universally hailed as a sensation and smash hit from day one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A few paragraphs later in Aaron Tilley and Yang Jie’s report:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For Apple’s first new major product in a decade — the Apple Watch\nwas announced in 2014 — Chief Executive Tim Cook has a lot on the\nline as the device attempts to dominate the virtual world where\npeople spend time for work or leisure, called the metaverse, which\nhasn’t yet reached mass adoption or understanding.</p>\n\n<p>There is growing skepticism among some investors and potential\nfuture partners that consumers will spend money and time on the\nmetaverse. They note some early adopters are disillusioned with\nthe technology.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a sidenote perhaps, but I’d argue that AirPods are a major new product — and that AirPods Pro are the first true mass-market augmented reality devices. The fact that they’re audio-only, and not visual, blinds people (sorry) to the fact that they’re <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/10/airpods_pro_first_impressions">remarkable AR products</a>. Apple doesn’t break out unit sales, but estimates suggest that if AirPods — just AirPods — were a standalone company, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls">it would have more revenue</a> than Nvidia, Adobe, or Uber, and might soon catch up to Netflix. But that’s a sidenote. </p>\n\n<p>The bigger issue is that back in October, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/10/26/stern-federighi-joz">in an on-stage interview</a>, Greg Joswiak was asked to complete the sentence “The metaverse is...”, and his answer was, “...a word I’ll never use.” The fact that people don’t use or even know what the hell the metaverse means is irrelevant to Apple’s headset. I don’t know how much more clear Joz could have been without revealing Apple’s headset then and there — <em>Apple’s not making something that’s just like what other companies already have on the market</em>. That on-stage interview was with ... <em>checks notes</em> ... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ugwoEOMvg">Joanna Stern at The Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference</a>. It’s enough to make you think Wall Street Journal reporters don’t read The Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n<p>That no XR headset introduced so far has made much of a dent in the universe isn’t a sign that Apple’s effort is ill-fated. It’s a sign that Apple has an opportunity. In a sense, Apple <em>does</em> have one tradition when entering a new product category: they endeavor to make <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">the first one good enough to be criticized</a>.</p>\n\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn1-2023-05-18">\n<p>Here’s a paragraph for the Annals of Prognostication from that same 2016 Wakabayashi report for the Journal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And yet, there are detractors such as Fred Wilson, co-founder of\nventure-capital firm Union Square Ventures, in December declared\nthe Watch a “flop.” Mr. Wilson, who owns shares of Fitbit through\na fund, had earlier predicted the Watch wouldn’t be a “home run”\nlike the iPad, iPhone and iPod, saying many people wouldn’t want\nto wear a computer on their wrist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/fred-wilson-predictions">Fred Wilson</a>, the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/05/wilson">next best thing</a> to <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/10/cnbcs-jim-cramer-touted-silicon-valley-bank-stock/">Jim Cramer</a>.&nbsp;<a class="footnoteBackLink" href="https://daringfireball.net/#fnr1-2023-05-18" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-19 01:41:49','John Gruber','https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/do_wall_street_journal_reporters_read_the_wall_street_journal');

Here’s Kif Leswing reporting for CNBC in January this year:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/01/apple-celebrates-a-groundbreaking-year-in-entertainment/">Apple said it has paid $320 billion to\ndevelopers</a>, up from $260 billion as of last year, a jump of\n$60 billion.

Epic lawsuit</a> that 70 percent of App Store revenue comes from gaming.</p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Wait wait wait I figured it out:</strong> My bad for misreading the numbers (which I think were confusingly described). I mistakenly thought Leswing was saying that Apple’s commissions were $70-85 billion last year. That’s <em>not</em> what he meant and that’s obviously far too high. But the math is really rather simple. $320 billion is the sum of Apple’s <em>cumulative</em> payments to developers from 2008 to 2022. $60 billion is what Apple paid to developers in 2022. Duh. Of <em>course</em> they didn’t pay $320 billion last year alone. So let’s assume that Apple’s average commission from App Store purchases is 25 percent, which seems both fair (given that 70 percent of App Store revenue comes from gaming and in-app purchases carry a 70/30 split) and makes the math really easy for last year. With $60 billion in payments to developers in 2022, Apple’s take was $20 billion. So about one quarter of Apple’s services revenue comes from App Store commissions — <em>that</em> squares perfectly with a common sense estimate. (Also: the fact that almost 20 percent of the App Store’s <em>cumulative</em> revenue was generated last year alone goes to show just how much it’s still growing.)]</p>\n\n<p>How in the world does GM CEO Mary Barra think they’re going to replicate anything like this?

[...]</p>\n\n<p>GM has a target to grow profit margins and double its revenue to\nabout $280 billion by the end of this decade. That includes\nsignificant growth in new business units and software.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m not familiar with Mike Abbott, but it sounds like his expertise is entirely in cloud services, not user-facing software design and engineering. So I don’t think Barra was thinking “<em>Apple makes great software that people love, so we should hire someone from Apple who knows how to lead such a team</em>”,<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-16"><a href="https://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2023-05-16">1</a></sup> but instead more like “<em>Apple has built an $80 billion per year services division that continues to grow each quarter, so we should hire someone who knows how to lead such a team</em>”. Barra is looking at <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/05/apple-q2-2023-results-94-8b-revenue-better-than-expected/">Apple’s services revenue</a>, not the quality of Apple’s CarPlay.</p>\n\n<p>That’s fine, and maybe someone like Abbott is exactly who GM needs. But I don’t look at this hire and think that GM is any more likely to come up with a CarPlay-quality interface for its own platform. Some back-of-the-envelope math on Barra’s services revenue goals for GM makes it sound to me like Mike Abbott is being tasked with designing an in-dash slot machine.</p>\n\n<p>When <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/04/gm_carplay_iphones">GM announced they were dropping CarPlay from their EVs</a> last month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/gm-plans-phase-out-apple-carplay-evs-with-googles-help-2023-03-31/">Reuters reported</a> that “Barra is aiming for $20 billion to $25 billion in annual revenue from subscriptions by 2030.”</p>\n\n<p>That seems very ambitious.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s look at GM’s current subscription services revenue. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/07/24/why-wall-street-loves-this-new-car-option-that-dri/">Here’s Larry Printz, writing for Motley Fool last July</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to company officials, GM generated nearly $2 billion in\nsubscription services revenue and EBIT margins north of 70% in\nfiscal 2021. The automaker currently has more than 4 million\nsubscribers. For 2021, GM’s global revenue was $127 billion,\nmeaning that if forecast proved true, OnStar accounted for 1.6% of\nGM’s worldwide revenue. While that may seem like a minimal\ncontribution to the bottom line, that figure should grow thanks to\nrecent additions to OnStar.</p>\n\n<p>GM recently announced a subscription plan for its SuperCruise\nself-driving feature, which is free for the first three years on\nnew vehicles. It also opened OnStar to owners of non-GM vehicles\nthrough a smartphone app, which should bring additional\nsubscribers — and income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To grow from $2 billion to $20 billion (the low end of Barra’s stated goal) by 2030, it seems safe to assume she’s expecting this growth to come from future car sales, not GM vehicles that are already on the road today.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/225326/amount-of-cars-sold-by-general-motors-worldwide/">GM sells about 6 million vehicles per year</a> — but that number has been declining since a peak of 10 million in 2016. Presumably, these future services will require vehicles equipped with GM’s new software platform. Right now they’re claiming this system will only be going into EVs, and in 2022, <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/629611/us-gm-plugin-car-sales-2022q4/">only 1.7 percent of GM vehicles sold were all-electric</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s be generous and say that by 2030, GM has sold 30 million vehicles eligible for <em>and subscribed to</em> the company’s new services. I think 30 million is very generous — if not outlandish — and would require them to put the new software platform in their gas and hybrid vehicles, too. Keep in mind they only had 4 million subscribers in 2021 and their vehicle sales are in decline.</p>\n\n<p>$20 billion in revenue from 30 million subscribers = $666/year/vehicle = $55/month/vehicle. That’s in line with their current average of $500/year per services subscriber ($2 billion in revenue from 4 million subscribers, per Motley Fool above), but it’s a lot of money per subscriber. I just don’t see how they grow from 4 million subscribers today to 30 million or more by 2030.</p>\n\n<p>What services could they offer that new car buyers would pay north of $50/month for? Maps and navigation? Everyone has that on their phones already. Music and podcasts? Everyone has that on their phones already. Crash detection? By 2030 everyone will have that on their phones already (or at least they will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213225">if they have iPhones</a>, but I bet that will soon become a standard feature on Android phones too). GM wants to sell “behavior based insurance” (translation: tracking/surveillance), but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-set-launch-behavior-based-us-driver-insurance-q1-executive-2022-01-24/">according to Reuters</a>, their goal for insurance is just $6 billion/year by 2030. I find it hard to see where the rest of the money will come from.</p>\n\n<p>GM executives might be dreaming that car buyers will pay GM for services they already get on their phones by not supporting CarPlay and Android Auto, but today’s reality shows that people will just buy $5 mounts to attach their phones to their vehicles’ dashboards. And if every other automaker continues to support CarPlay and Android Auto, it just seems like this entire endeavor will turn into an expensive boondoggle that steers would-be GM buyers to other brands.</p>\n\n<p>One idea that occurred to me is the equivalent of Apple’s services revenue dark matter: payments from Google for default placement as Safari’s search engine. Neither Apple nor Google has ever disclosed those numbers, but <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/05/apple-default-search-engine/">one recent estimate</a> pegs it at $20 billion per year. At a minimum, it’s $10 billion per year. Those payments from Google go into “Services” in Apple’s quarterly results. Apple now reports $20 billion in services revenue per <em>quarter</em> — so most of that is coming from the App Store, and then customer subscriptions to things like iCloud Plus, Apple Music, etc., but somewhere around 20-25 percent of it comes from Google paying to be the default search engine in Safari. With GM’s upcoming in-house software system not supporting CarPlay or Android Auto, but made in partnership with Google (based on Google’s confusingly-named <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive">Android Automotive</a> platform) presumably Google Maps (and/or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23499734/google-maps-waze-development-teams-combined-productivity">Waze</a>?) will be the one and only choice for mapping and navigation, and perhaps Google will pay GM for that privilege? And for default placement for other services like music? Even if that’s the deal, though, I don’t see how it gets GM close to $20 billion in services revenue per year. Apple gets $15-20 billion from Google for default search engine placement in Safari on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021">over one billion</a> iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Even my kindest, most optimistic estimate pegs eligible GM vehicles at just 30 million by 2030. Would Google pay GM 30–40 times more per car to provide the default mapping app than they pay Apple per iPhone/iPad/Mac? That doesn’t make sense to me, but I suppose it’s theoretically possible that mapping surveillance data is <em>that</em> valuable to Google. I really fucking doubt it, though.</p>\n\n<p>The one and only thing I can think of that GM can charge a subscription for that drivers can’t get via their phones is semi-autonomous driving. GM calls this Super Cruise and <a href="https://www.onstar.com/plans/premium">currently charges $25/month for it</a>, or $15/month for drivers who also subscribe to OnStar. (OnStar offers roadside assistance and crash detection — which, again, everyone will have for free with their phones by 2030.) But Super Cruise could exist as a standalone subscription feature <em>alongside</em> support for CarPlay and Android Auto — and in fact does today. Charging a subscription fee for Super Cruise doesn’t require GM to drop support for CarPlay and Android Auto integration.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t see how these ballpark numbers make any sense. It’s an enormous bet against the primacy of the phone in people’s lives, with no one yet, in any industry, ever having won a bet against the phone. GM’s $20–25 billion target for services revenue by 2030 feels like a <a href="https://succession.fandom.com/wiki/Kendall_Roy">Kendall Roy number</a> — plucked out of thin air by someone just making up figures in an Excel spreadsheet until they get the <code>SUM()</code> result they’re looking for.</p>\n\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn1-2023-05-16">\n<p>I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever this could have happened, but imagine if GM had hired Scott Forstall to lead their software division.

She asks him about GM’s plan to drop CarPlay from their future EVs, and Farley starts by saying “Yeah, how about that?” and laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Farley says, “The interior has to be really well done. But in terms of content? We kind of lost that battle 10 years ago. So get real with it, because you’re not going to make a ton of money on content inside the vehicle. It’s going to be safety/security, partial autonomy, and productivity in our eyes. [...] 70 percent of our Ford customers in the U.S. are Apple customers. Why would I go to an Apple customer and say ‘Good luck!’? That doesn’t seem customer centric.”</p>\n\n<p>Farley and Ford have it exactly right. New car buyers, even from mainstream brands like Ford, are overwhelmingly iPhone users — exactly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156741/ios-16-carplay-apple-wwdc-hvac-deeper-integration">as Apple bragged at WWDC last June</a>, and what iPhone users want in their cars is CarPlay. If anything, Farley is being kind to GM and GM CEO Mary Barra when he says their message to iPhone users is “Good luck” — it’s really more like “Fuck you.” And again, the most telling part of the whole exchange is the way Farley laughs at the start. You really have to hear it — his laugh implies a certain <em>I can’t believe our good fortune that GM is doing this.</em> It’s enough to make you think Mary Barra is a mole from Ford, planted to steer would-be Chevy buyers into Ford dealerships.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re asking how it can be that 70 percent of Ford’s customers are iPhone users when the iPhone has maybe just over 50 percent market share in the U.S., the key is <em>new</em> car buyers. The Android masses are buying used cars, either because they don’t have the budget for a new car or because they don’t care about buying nice things (or both). So even a non-luxury brand like Ford has an overwhelming majority of customers with iPhones.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/05/ford-ceo-jim-farley-carplay" title="Permanent link to ‘Ford CEO Jim Farley Seems Very Happy That GM Is Dropping CarPlay’">&nbsp;★&nbsp;</a>\n</div>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-06 00:59:02','John Gruber','https://www.wsj.com/video/ford-ceo-on-apple-google-and-elon-musk/B6D8BC45-1C4A-45D3-97AC-933A57B76E31.html');

As Benton points out, the most striking thing in Statcounter’s report is the decline in Windows’s desktop OS share over the last year, both <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">globally</a> and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">in the U.S.</a> I suspect Windows is losing share to <em>mobile</em> browsing just as much as or more than it is to MacOS and ChromeOS. Back when Windows had over 90 percent market share, a huge chunk of that was people who didn’t really choose a Windows PC because of Windows, but who just wanted a “computer”. They took the default, and the default computer ran Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, Windows still gets most of the default <em>desktop</em> market (although it seem ChromeOS continues to eat into that, especially in K-12 education). But for more and more people, their default “computer” is their phone. They might have a PC, but they use it less and less.</p>\n\n<p>Which brings me to another real eye-opener: Statcounter’s OS market share numbers — across all devices, desktop and mobile — from 2009 until now.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share#monthly-200901-202303">Globally</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a class="noborder" href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/StatCounter-os_combined-ww-monthly-200901-202303.png">\n  <img alt="Chart showing Statcounter''s global market share for operating system from January 2009 through March 2023." src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/StatCounter-os_combined-ww-monthly-200901-202303.png" width="500" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/all/united-states-of-america#monthly-200901-202303">United States</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a class="noborder" href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/StatCounter-os_combined-US-monthly-200901-202303.png">\n  <img alt="Chart showing Statcounter''s U.S. market share for operating system from January 2009 through March 2023." src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2023/05/StatCounter-os_combined-US-monthly-200901-202303.png" width="500" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Globally, Windows was surpassed by Android back in 2017. The decline in Windows’s dominance has been precipitous: in 2009 Statcounter pegged its share at 95 percent; today it’s 28 percent. In the U.S., Windows is effectively neck-and-neck with iOS, each hovering around 30 percent for the last few years. It doesn’t seem outlandish to project that Mac and iOS, combined, might soon surpass Windows and Android combined in Statcounter’s share numbers for the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>The Mac, on the other hand, is clearly seeing impressive market share growth. We all kind of knew this was true from the Mac revenue numbers <a href="https://sixcolors.com/tag/quarterly/">Apple reports each quarter</a>, but Statcounter’s data backs up Apple’s claims that the Mac continues to gain new users. And that in turn leads to more desktop Safari users — even though recent switchers strike me as among the most likely Mac users to use Chrome, which they’re likely familiar with. But if desktop Safari usage share is growing, it must mean Mac usage is growing.</p>\n\n<p>The rise of iOS and Android as humanity’s primary computing platforms has obliterated Windows’s decades-long hegemony. To be fair, when your usage share was at one time 95 percent <em>of all web browsing</em>, there’s nowhere to go but down. But today, Windows is just one of four major platforms — and is the only one of the four that is in obvious decline, both in usage and relevance. The Mac, on the other hand, has seemingly been <em>bolstered</em> by the rise of the iPhone. We talked a lot about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2007/10/milhouse">the “halo effect” of the iPod</a> on Mac sales in the mid-2000s, but it’s more true today with the iPhone and iPad. Mac unit sales are up and its share of desktop computing is <em>way</em> up. People who don’t care about desktop computing are just using their phones and tablets for everything; people who do care are more likely than ever to be using a Mac.</p>\n\n<p>One more nugget, just for kicks — <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america#monthly-202201-202303">U.S.</a> and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/worldwide#monthly-202201-202303">worldwide</a> numbers for iOS and Android in the mobile market:</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n  <th></th>\n  <th>U.S.</th>\n  <th>Global</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n  <td>iOS</td>\n  <td>60</td>\n  <td>30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <td>Android</td>\n  <td>40</td>\n  <td>69</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting on the charts above that in hindsight, it wasn’t clear that mobile browsing would surpass desktop browsing until 2013 or 2014 — six or seven years after the debut of the iPhone. That’s a timeframe worth keeping in mind for — oh, just to pick a random up-and-coming product category — AR/VR headsets. The iPhone did change everything, but it took a while to show it outside the enthusiast / early-adopter market.</p>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-02 23:11:18','John Gruber','https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/browser_and_os_market_share_trends_in_the_mobile_age');

That same service was soon renamed .Mac, then MobileMe (and Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201771">changed the domain name to me.com</a>), then, finally, iCloud (and icloud.com).</p></li>\n<li><p>When I signed up for my iTunes account <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/227143/15-years-of-itunes-a-look-at-apples-media-app-and-its-influence-on-an-industry.html">when the iTunes Music Store launched back in April 2003</a>, I used my primary @daringfireball.net address, not my @mac.com address. I don’t recall why I did this exactly, but I <em>think</em> that what I was thinking was something along the lines of “<em>I’m still not sure about this whole .Mac thing, but I’m pretty sure I’ll have my daringfireball.net address forever.</em>”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In hindsight, this was a mistake on my part. Everything is simpler if you only have one Apple ID that you use for both iCloud and iTunes/App Store purchases. The reason I never switched to using my mac.com iCloud account for everything, including purchases, is that there’s never been a way to migrate old purchases from a different account. And I’ve bought a lot of music, movies, and apps over the years using my other account.<sup id="fnr1-2023-05-01"><a href="https://daringfireball.net/#fn1-2023-05-01">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Using split accounts has always been a bit weird, occasionally problematic and/or confusing — but has mostly just worked out. It helps quite a bit that there are a <em>lot</em> of people working at Apple in the same situation. By the time the iPhone became a hit product, users new to the Apple ecosystem naturally used one address for everything. But split accounts are common from long-time Mac users, and there are a lot of long-time Mac users inside Apple.</p>\n\n<p>This situation I ran into — seeing a promotion for a three-month Apple Arcade trial despite the fact that I pay for Apple One (which includes Arcade) — is just one of those glitches. Most Apple One subscribers don’t have split accounts, so they never saw the unnecessary promotion. And even amongst those who <em>do</em> have split accounts, they’d have to run into a certain set of circumstances to make it appear.<sup id="fnr2-2023-05-01"><a href="https://daringfireball.net/#fn2-2023-05-01">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>So, it was a bug. And I am reliably informed that a fix is in the works that will appear in a near-future update to iOS.</p>\n\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id="fn1-2023-05-01">\n<p>No joke, I’ve purchased 744 movies (and counting) from iTunes over the last two decades. Money runs through my fingers like water.&nbsp;<a class="footnoteBackLink" href="https://daringfireball.net/#fnr1-2023-05-01" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id="fn2-2023-05-01">\n<p>One way that it’s confusing to have multiple Apple IDs is that it’s my iCloud account — my mac.com address — that serves as the primary account for family sharing with my wife and son. But it’s my other account — my daringfireball.net address — that has made all my iTunes and App Store purchases for 23 years. That includes making the purchase to subscribe to Apple One, even though Apple One includes features like additional iCloud storage space that apply to my iCloud account. So even though I have two accounts, one for iCloud and one for purchases, Apple’s back end is somehow capable of making it all work. They are two different accounts, but my iTunes account purchases can be shared through my iCloud account’s family sharing. It sounds confusing, I know. But for the last decade or so, it really has <em>just worked</em> and I haven’t had to think about it often, other than keeping two different passwords in my head.&nbsp;<a class="footnoteBackLink" href="https://daringfireball.net/#fnr2-2023-05-01" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>','\n',char(10)),'','2023-05-01 21:27:40','John Gruber','https://daringfireball.net/2023/05/followup_on_apple_services_ad');

Gratteri afferma che hanno costruito nuovi sistemi di comunicazione sopra le nostre teste, utilizzando hacker che vengono pagati per garantire la sicurezza delle loro comunicazioni. Al contrario, l''Italia non è stata in grado di infiltrare o intercettare tali sistemi come hanno fatto altri paesi come il Costa Rica, la Francia, l''Olanda e la Germania. Il Procuratore sostiene ulteriormente che l''Italia dovrebbe investire in tecnologie, ricerca e assumere ingegneri informatici e hacker per colmare questa lacuna.</p> <p>Queste organizzazioni hanno adattato le proprie attività ai cambiamenti della società e hanno iniziato a utilizzare i social media, in particolare TikTok, per promuovere il proprio potere, l''immagine e reclutare nuovi membri. Utilizzando queste piattaforme, trasmettono uno stile di vita basato su lusso, soldi, potere e influenze.</p> <p>La delinquenza organizzata sta creando una nuova narrazione di sé stessa sui social media, che non richiede più il cinema come intermediario. Utilizzando emoji, hashtag virali e musica trap, comunicano in modo criptico ma efficace. La narrazione è basata su denaro contante, lusso, feste, minacce ai rivali, armi e simboli che indicano appartenenza al clan.</p> <p>Le organizzazioni italiane hanno imparato molte tattiche dai cartelli messicani del narcotraffico, che utilizzano da tempo YouTube per sfidare lo Stato mostrando la propria forza militare. Tuttavia, differiscono dai cartelli sudamericani, perché quest''ultimi hanno una strategia comunicativa più consolidata, mentre le organizzazioni italiane sfruttano i social media in modo più individuale.</p> <p>In conclusione, tutte le organizzazioni criminali, comprese le mafie italiane, reclutano hacker e utilizzano i social media come strumenti di comunicazione e reclutamento.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AlessandroIT"> /u/AlessandroIT </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/13orc5p/le_mafie_nellera_digitale_il_procuratore_gratteri/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/13orc5p/le_mafie_nellera_digitale_il_procuratore_gratteri/">[comments]</a></span>','','2023-05-22 13:44:06','/u/AlessandroIT','https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/13orc5p/le_mafie_nellera_digitale_il_procuratore_gratteri/');

Colpito dal flashback del progetto di programmazione sui cui lavorai (secoli fa) con amici (e amica speciale) ho deciso di darci un''occhiata,very bad.</p> <p><strong>Il generatore - Chi lo usa</strong></p> <p>Il software in oggetto è il <a href="https://wwwservizi.regione.emilia-romagna.it/generatore/Default.aspx">Generatore di numeri casuali dell''Emilia-Romagna</a> con una descrizione algoritmica <a href="https://wwwservizi.regione.emilia-romagna.it/generatore/Note.aspx">qui</a> Il generatore è usato da una grande quantità di enti (non solo dell''Emilia-Romagna) ogni qual volta è necessario fare un sorteggio: dall''ispezione delle pratiche sismiche, a concorsi, a bandi di appalto etc. Con una ricerca su google:</p> <pre><code>link:https://wwwservizi.regione.emilia-romagna.it/generatore/Default.aspx </code></pre> <p>potete farvi un''idea (tra l''altro un''idea dei solo documenti pubblici, pubblicati online e che hanno copiato il link direttamente nel documento).</p> <p><strong>Il generatore - Come funziona</strong></p> <p>Leggendo i dettagli già la prima frase indica un nozionismo che era già veccchio quando entrai all''università:</p> <blockquote> <p>Si premette subito che un computer, in quanto macchina assolutamente priva di arbitrio (ovvero deterministica), non è in grado di generare dei numeri casuali nel senso letterale del termine.</p> </blockquote> <p>La riflessione filosofica accidentale per cui avere &quot;arbitrio&quot; sia necessario per generare numeri casuali è interessante (lo sapevo che il D20 aveva libero arbitrio!) specialmente per il fatto che chi ha scritto questa descrizione ha già confusione tra &quot;arbitrio&quot; e &quot;determinismo&quot;.</p> <p>Ma passiamo ai dettagli:</p> <blockquote> <p>L''algoritmo utilizzato in questo sito è noto in letteratura e la sua &quot;bontà&quot;, nel senso che genera una sequenza con le stesse proprietà statistiche di una sequenza casuale, è stata dimostrata, con i test statistici del caso. Si tratta di un generatore di Lehmer, ovverosia un generatore congruenziale moltiplicativo. Di particolare importanza per la bontà della sequenza è la scelta dei valori di a, c e m. Nel caso di questo sito i valori scelti sono stati tratti dalla letteratura e sono: m=2147483647 (2<sup>31-1),</sup> a=1103515245 e c=0 Allora già qui il discorso è chiuso, nel senso che l''algoritmo è considerato &quot;debole&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ma qui siamo ben oltre le considerazioni dimensionali o statistiche dell''algoritmo (pessime in raffronto con altre implementazioni): al di là della fragilità dell''algoritmo il problema è che viene lasciato all''utilizzatore la scelta del &quot;seed&quot;. dato il seed è possibile prevedere i numeri. Ora lasciare all''utilizzatore (dotato di arbitrio) la scelta del seme porta a situazioni così:</p> <p><a href="https://bandigare.comune.cento.fe.it/PortaleAppalti/do/FrontEnd/DocDig/downloadDocumentoPubblico.action;jsessionid=7C1D71FE3D903B8CC99F36EBD11901F2?id=1043&amp;idprg=&amp;_csrf=F3P8STAN9JLK9URGWLLJI2DE73H7AT5K">Comune di cento: Data del sorteggio</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.comune.santavenerina.ct.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Sorteggio-componenti-commissione-giudicatrice.pdf">Comune di santavenerina: Seme &quot;scelto&quot; dal dipendente</a></p> <p>Apprezzabile e concettualmente difendibile: <a href="https://sua.cittametropolitana.genova.it/sites/default/files/Allegati/ID.4514.G.08.00_verbale%20seduta%20sorteggio%20operatori%20da%20inv%20per%20SUA.pdf">Comune di genova: Estrazioni del lotto</a></p> <p>Altri li potete trovare online trattandosi di che per loro stessa natura dovrebbero essere pubblicati.</p> <p><strong>Riassumendo</strong> </p> <p>Chi sceglie il seed decide l''esito del sorteggio: pensate a un funzionario che sceglie la data del sorteggio di una gara: saprà già chi viene estratto.</p> <p>Pensate a chi deve presentare una pratica che potrebbe essere sottoposta a ispezione &quot;a sorteggio&quot;, ma sa che l''estrazione viene fatta con il seed YYYYMMDD per cui certi numeri non saranno generati (esempio &quot;1&quot;) e quindi si presenta alle 4 del mattino per essere il primo del mese a presentare la pratica.</p> <p>Tra l''altro il seme deve avere certe caratteristiche quando impiegato con quel tipo di algoritmi deboli, pena proprietà indesiderabili...
